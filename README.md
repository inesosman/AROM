# AROM
A novel approach for refactoring and merging multiple ontologies at a time using alignments

These are three equivalence correspondences from the "Large Biomedical Ontologies" OAEI reference alignments.

The first correspondence matches the "Skin_of_head" class (from FMA) to the "Head_Skin" class (from NCI).

The second correspondence matches the "Skin_structure_of_head" class (from SNOMED) to the "Head_Skin" class (from NCI).
